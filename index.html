    <h1>What is the goal of this test?</h1>
    <p>
      The goal of this test is to demonstrate how we can make a favicon icon
      that changes color depending on the users theme to try not blend into the
      tab bar.
      <br />
      NOTE: the favicon may not update until you refresh the page if you are
      switching themes.
      <br>
      <br>
      How do I switch themes?</br>
      On windows this means going into your windows settings, and changing from light to dark. For other os's, you will have to look this up.
      <br>
      The favicon should be the same color as the svg below (white when your in dark theme, black when you are in light theme).):
    </p>
    <svg
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
      width="512"
      height="512"
      viewBox="0 0 100 100"
    >
      <style>
        circle {
          fill: black;
        }
        @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
          circle {
            fill: white;
          }
        }
      </style>
      <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="green" stroke-width="4" />
    </svg>
